# Mandatory Rules

## Language Requirements
Always use JavaScript for the code, no matter what.

## Code Changes
When you change the code, make sure no existing functionality is lost, unless the user explicitly asked for it to be removed.

## Best Practices
- Maintain clean, readable code
- Preserve existing game logic and functionality
- Test changes before committing
